# 🚀 Turnstile-Solver Integration Complete

## What's Been Integrated

Your Mass Checker now uses the **Turnstile-Solver** repository for advanced Cloudflare bypass instead of basic Playwright. Here's what's changed:

### ✅ Enhanced Browser Automation
- **Replaced**: Basic Playwright automation
- **With**: Advanced Turnstile-Solver browser automation using:
  - **Patchright** (enhanced Playwright with better stealth)
  - **Camoufox** (Firefox-based with maximum fingerprint resistance)
  - **Advanced stealth scripts** from Turnstile-Solver

### ✅ Advanced Turnstile Solving
- **Automatic sitekey detection** for Turnstile challenges
- **Advanced solving techniques** from Turnstile-Solver
- **Multiple interaction strategies** for different challenge types
- **Fallback mechanisms** if advanced solving fails

### ✅ API Service Integration
- **Turnstile API service** starts automatically with your bot
- **Background processing** of complex challenges
- **Multi-threaded** challenge solving
- **Proxy support** integrated with your existing proxy system

### ✅ Preserved Your Features
- ✅ **Proxy rotation** - All your proxy logic works exactly the same
- ✅ **User agent rotation** - Enhanced with more variety
- ✅ **Account checking flow** - Same Telegram bot interface
- ✅ **File upload system** - Upload accounts/proxies as before
- ✅ **Progress tracking** - Same progress reporting
- ✅ **Result categorization** - Valid/Invalid/2FA/Captcha/Error

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables (.env file)
```bash
# Enable enhanced features
USE_ENHANCED_BROWSER=1
PREFERRED_BROWSER_TYPE=chromium
ENABLE_TURNSTILE_SERVICE=1

# Turnstile service settings
TURNSTILE_SERVICE_HOST=127.0.0.1
TURNSTILE_SERVICE_PORT=5000
TURNSTILE_SERVICE_THREADS=2

# Debug (set to 1 for detailed logs)
DEBUG_ENHANCED_FEATURES=0
```

### Browser Types Available
1. **chromium** (default) - Good balance of stealth and compatibility
2. **chrome** - If you have Chrome installed
3. **msedge** - If you have Edge installed  
4. **camoufox** - Maximum stealth (requires: `python -m camoufox fetch`)

## 🛡️ How Cloudflare Bypass Works Now

### Before (Basic Playwright)
1. Detect challenge → Click elements → Hope it works
2. Limited stealth features
3. Basic user agent rotation

### After (Turnstile-Solver Integration)
1. **Detect challenge** → Extract sitekey if available
2. **Advanced solving** → Use Turnstile-Solver techniques
3. **Multiple strategies** → Try different interaction methods
4. **Enhanced stealth** → Patchright/Camoufox with advanced fingerprint resistance
5. **API fallback** → Use Turnstile API service for complex challenges

## 🚀 Usage (Same as Before!)

1. **Start bot**: `python main.py`
2. **Upload proxies**: Send .txt file with proxies
3. **Upload accounts**: Send .txt file with email:password
4. **Start checking**: Click "Start Checking" button
5. **Enhanced bypass**: Turnstile challenges are now automatically solved!
